# Restaurant-prediction
machine learning model for restaurant prediction
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the rating of restaurants based on various features such as location, average cost, cuisine, and user votes.

📌 Project Overview

The objective is to build a regression model that predicts restaurant ratings. This can help:

Food delivery platforms estimate missing ratings.

Customers discover better restaurants.

Businesses understand what factors affect ratings.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Algorithms Tried: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains restaurant details with features such as:
